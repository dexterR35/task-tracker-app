# Firebase Setup Instructions

## ✅ Firebase Configuration

Firebase is now configured with hardcoded credentials in `src/app/firebase.js`. No environment variables are needed.

### Current Configuration

The Firebase configuration is directly embedded in the code:

```javascript
const getFirebaseConfig = () => {
  return {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyABUgnH7wwm9RVFaf7wuSHEzfhUDtiXCtI",
    authDomain: "task-tracker-app-eb03e.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "task-tracker-app-eb03e",
    storageBucket: "task-tracker-app-eb03e.firebasestorage.app",
    messagingSenderId: "976694748809",
    appId: "1:976694748809:web:4a1d4c0a72ad588e2fc858",
  };
};
```

### Project Details

- **Project ID**: `task-tracker-app-eb03e`
- **Firebase Console**: [https://console.firebase.google.com/project/task-tracker-app-eb03e](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/task-tracker-app-eb03e)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Simply run your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

No additional setup is required - Firebase is ready to use!

## ⚠️ Security Note

- Firebase credentials are now hardcoded in the source code
- This approach is suitable for development and testing
- For production deployments, consider using environment variables for better security

## 🎯 Expected Result

After completing these steps, your Firebase configuration should work correctly and you should see:

```
✅ Firebase app initialized successfully
✅ Auth persistence configured
✅ Session management active
```
