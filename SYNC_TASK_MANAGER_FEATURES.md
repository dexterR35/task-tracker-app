## Part III: Core Features Implementation

### 9. Authentication & Authorization

The authentication and authorization system is a critical component that ensures secure access to the SYNC application. This system handles user authentication, session management, and role-based access control.

#### 9.1 Authentication Architecture

The authentication system is built on Firebase Authentication with custom session management. This provides a robust, scalable solution that supports multiple authentication methods and integrates seamlessly with the application's security requirements.

**Firebase Integration**: Firebase Authentication provides the foundation for user authentication, supporting email/password, Google OAuth, and custom token authentication. This service handles the complex security aspects of authentication, including password hashing, token management, and security best practices.

**Session Management**: Custom session management extends Firebase's capabilities to provide application-specific session handling. This includes session timeout management, concurrent session limits, and session persistence across browser sessions.

**Token Management**: JWT tokens are used for secure communication between the client and server. These tokens contain user information and permissions, allowing for stateless authentication and reducing server-side session storage requirements.

#### 9.2 User Authentication Flow

The authentication flow is designed to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining security standards:

**Login Process**: Users enter their credentials through the login form. The application validates the input and authenticates with Firebase. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is generated and stored securely.

**Registration Process**: New users can create accounts through the registration form. The system validates email addresses, enforces password strength requirements, and creates user profiles in the database.

**Password Reset**: Users can reset their passwords through a secure email-based process. This includes email verification and temporary token generation for security.

**Multi-Factor Authentication**: The system supports optional multi-factor authentication for enhanced security. This can include SMS verification, email verification, or authenticator app integration.

#### 9.3 Authorization & Permissions

Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users can only access features and data appropriate to their role within the organization.

**User Roles**: The system defines several user roles including Admin, Manager, Team Lead, and Regular User. Each role has specific permissions and access levels.

**Permission System**: Permissions are granular and can be assigned at the feature, page, or data level. This allows for fine-grained access control based on organizational needs.

**Resource Protection**: All sensitive resources are protected by permission checks. This includes API endpoints, UI components, and data access operations.

**Audit Logging**: All authentication and authorization events are logged for security auditing and compliance purposes.

#### 9.4 Security Implementation

Security is implemented at multiple levels to protect user data and application integrity:

**Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated using comprehensive validation rules. This prevents injection attacks and ensures data integrity.

**CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is implemented to prevent unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.

**Rate Limiting**: API endpoints implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect against brute force attacks.

**Secure Headers**: HTTP security headers are configured to protect against common web vulnerabilities including XSS, clickjacking, and content sniffing.

### 10. Task Management System
